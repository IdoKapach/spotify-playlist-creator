# Spotify Playlist Creator
This project creates a playlist featuring the 5 highest-rated songs on a specified date, according to billboard.com. You will input the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD during the program's execution.

The file song-list.txt contains the top 100 songs as of December 7, 2000 (my birthday ðŸ˜Š).

## The playlist will be published on my Spotify channel, @idopython10, under the name "Best Songs on YYYY-MM-DD" (the specified date).
## Feel free to check it out!
